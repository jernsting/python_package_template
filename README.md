# How to implement a PHOTONAI module
Take a look at some of our modules like <a href="https://github.com/wwu-mmll/photonai_neuro">PHOTONAI neuro</a> 
or <a href="https://github.com/wwu-mmll/photonai_graph">PHOTONAI graph</a>.

Implement your algorithms in this repository and add them to the `json` File with the full path.
An example is provided within this repository. 

Feel free to reach out via issues in case of problems.
